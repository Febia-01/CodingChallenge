Print Words Vertically -> Leetcode 1324

Illustration:
Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
ans: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
Each word is printed vertically. 
 "HAY"
 "ORO"
 "WEU"

Solution:
Split the string into words: Split the input string s into an array of words using the split() method. Find the maximum word length: Find the length of the longest word using a loop. This will determine the number of vertical words we will need to create.
Create vertical words:
  Iterate through each character position (from 0 to maxLen - 1).
  For each character position, create a StringBuilder to build the vertical word.
  Iterate through each word in the array:
    If the current character position exists in the word, append the character to the StringBuilder.
    Otherwise, append a space to the StringBuilder.
  Trim trailing spaces from the built string and add them to the result list.
Return the result: Return the list of vertical words.

class Solution {
    public List<String> printVertically(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, word.length());
        }

        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < maxLen; i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (String word : words) {
                if (i < word.length()) {
                    sb.append(word.charAt(i));
                } else {
                    sb.append(" ");
                }
            }
            result.add(sb.toString().stripTrailing()); 
        }

        return result;
    }
}
