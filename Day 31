Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk -> Leetcode 1894

Illustration:
Input: chalk = [5,1,5], k = 22
The students go in turns as follows:
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 17.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 16.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 11.
- Student number 0 uses 5 chalk, so k = 6.
- Student number 1 uses 1 chalk, so k = 5.
- Student number 2 uses 5 chalk, so k = 0.
Student number 0 does not have enough chalk, so they will have to replace it.
ans: 0

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        long s = 0;
        for (int x : chalk) {
            s += x;
        }
        k %= s;
        for (int i = 0;; ++i) {
            if (k < chalk[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            k -= chalk[i];
        }
    }
}
