Assign Cookies -> Leetcode 455

Illustration:
g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
ans: 1

Solution:
- Sorting & Two pointer method used
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int m = g.length;
        int n = s.length;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            while (j < n && s[j] < g[i]) {
                ++j;
            }
            if (j++ >= n) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return m;
    }
}
